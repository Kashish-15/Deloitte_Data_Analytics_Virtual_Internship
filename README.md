# Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Virtual Internship (via Forage)

This repository contains my completed work for the **Deloitte Australia – Data Analytics Job Simulation** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/).

Over this virtual internship, I solved real-world problems faced by Deloitte clients across two major tasks: telemetry analysis and forensic pay equality review.
